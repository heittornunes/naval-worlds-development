Hello, and welcome to the readme of Naval Worlds.

Naval Worlds is a game type MOBA, that you can play with your friends, attack ennemies and play solo.

Our game still in development, but we will try to publish it as soon as we can.

# Characters

Characters can be awarded as you complete challanges, buy N-Tokenz or just be lucky and open a crate!

Our characters are unique, every single one has different powers, HPs, etc...

The characters will be classified by the rarity. We have 3 rarities:

• Common

• Rare

• Epic

# PC or MOBILE

The game will be released for Personal Computer (Windows) or Mobile devices (just Android for now)

# Final Notes

We haven't released the game yet, but we will try our best to do it!
